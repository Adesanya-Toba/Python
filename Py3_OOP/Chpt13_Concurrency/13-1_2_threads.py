# The threading.Event class is Pythonâ€™s simplest signalling mechanism to coordinate
# threads. An Event instance has an internal boolean flag that starts as False. Calling
# Event.set() sets the flag to True. While the flag is false, if a thread calls
# Event.wait(), it is blocked until another thread calls Event.set(), at which time
# Event.wait() returns True. If a timeout in seconds is given to Event.wait(s), this
# call returns False when the timeout elapses, or returns True as soon as Event.set()
# is called by another thread
